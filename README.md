B.Tech project at IIT(BHU): Program to implement Spencer's limit equilibrium method for slope stability analysis 
The project contains a .NET plug in for AutoCAD. 
The .NET application is of Windows Forms library template used to create a form to take user input for slope, soil and test curve parameters.
The form also contains 4 buttons. Coding is done to activate the 4 buttons to draw slope, slices to AutoCAD and to calculate the factor of safety of the test curve and the minimum factor of safety in the zone according to Spencer's Limit equilibrium analysis.
