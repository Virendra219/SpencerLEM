# SpencerLEM
<br /> B.Tech project at IIT(BHU): Program to implement Spencer's limit equilibrium method for slope stability analysis 
<br /> The project contains a .NET plug in for AutoCAD. 
<br /> The .NET application is of Windows Forms library template used to create a form to take user input for slope, soil and test curve parameters.
<br /> The form also contains 4 buttons. Coding is done to activate the 4 buttons to draw slope, slices to AutoCAD and to calculate the factor of safety of the test curve and the minimum factor of safety in the zone according to Spencer's Limit equilibrium analysis.
<br /> The class1.cs file contains the main code for the command method which would display the input file when the command is entered in the command prompt in AutoCAD.
<br /> The form1.cs file contains the code for the form tools. It reads the input from the form, executes Spencer's LME and displays outputs on AutoCAD and textboxes on the form as required.
